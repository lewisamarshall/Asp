Asp - The Acessible Solution Properties simulator
===================

A set of Matlab classes and methods for simulating the properties of ionic solutions.

These simulations are derived from work done by Supreet Bahga in
Electrophoresis 2010, "Ionic strength effects on electrophoretic focusing and separations", as well as SPRESSO and associated simulations by 
Moran Bercovici. 

These simulations make many internal solution properties accessible, and 
simplifies the initialization of the solution.
