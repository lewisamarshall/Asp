function Cb=buffering_capacity(obj)
	% BUFFERING_CAPACITY finds the buffering capacity of a solution. 
	%	This function generates an exact solution to the buffering
	%	capacity by finding the derivative of the pH with respect to
	%	the addition of an acid.
			
	% Find the smallest concentration in the solution. 
	c=obj.concentrations(obj.concentrations>0);
	c=0.1*min(c);
	% Add an acid insult at 1% the lowest concentration in the solution.
	new_sol=obj.add_ion(ion('Acid Insult', -1, -2, -1), c);
	% Find the slope of the pH. 
	Cb=abs(c/(obj.pH-new_sol.pH));
